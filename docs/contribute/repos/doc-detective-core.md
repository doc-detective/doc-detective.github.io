# `doc-detective-core`

[`doc-detective-core`](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective-core) is an NPM package that contains config and test logic and actually runs tests. It's installable via NPM (`npm i doc-detective-core`). This package contains the logic for performing each test action.

This repo depends on [`doc-detective-common`](doc-detective-common) for JSON schema definitions, schema validation logic, and path resolution logic.
