# Standard changes (10-30 minutes)

Add new content, examples, and improvements to the documentation. You can work in your browser or set up a local development environment.

## What counts as a standard contribution

- Adding missing steps to tutorials
- Providing code examples
- Adding troubleshooting tips
- Adding "See also" links
- Expanding brief explanations
- Adding diagrams or screenshots

## Two ways to work

### Option 1: Browser-based (easier)

Use GitHub's web editor for smaller additions:

1. Use the **Edit this page** button on any doc page
2. Make your changes using the web editor
3. Commit and create a pull request

ðŸ‘‰ See [Quick changes](quick-start) for detailed instructions.

Good for adding a few paragraphs, code examples, or list items.

### Option 2: Local development (more powerful)

Set up a local environment to preview changes as you write:

ðŸ‘‰ See [Local Development Setup](local-development) for detailed instructions.

Good for adding multiple sections, working across multiple files, or seeing live previews.

## Using content templates

Templates help you structure your contribution and ensure you include all the important information.

Choose the template that matches what you're creating:

| Template | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [How-to guide](templates/how-to) | Task-focused step-by-step instructions |
| [Tutorial](templates/tutorial) | Learning-oriented guide through a complete workflow |
| [Troubleshooting entry](templates/troubleshooting) | Problem-solution format |
| [Reference](templates/reference) | Technical specifications or API documentation |
| [Feature documentation](templates/feature) | Document a new or changed feature |

## Content guidelines

### Structure your content

Use clear headings to organize information:

```markdown
## Before you begin

Prerequisites and setup information

## Step 1: First major action

Detailed instructions

## Step 2: Next major action

More instructions

## What's next

Related topics and next steps
```

### Write clear instructions

âœ… **Do**

- Use second person ("you") and active voice
- Start steps with action verbs: "Click", "Type", "Navigate"
- Put conditions before instructions: "If you want to save, click **Save**"
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items

â›” **Don't**

- Use first person ("we") or passive voice
- Start steps with "Now" or "Then"
- Bury conditions in the middle of instructions
- Mix ordered and unordered lists

### Code examples

Always test code examples before submitting:

````markdown
```json title="example-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://doc-detective.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Include

- **Language identifier**: json, bash, typescript, etc.
- **File name** (optional): Use `title="filename.ext"`
- **Context**: Explain what the code does before showing it

### Links and references

Link to related documentation:

```markdown
See [Actions](/docs/category/actions) for available test actions.
```

Use

- **Absolute paths** for internal links: `/docs/path/to/page`
- **HTTPS** for external links: `https://example.com`
- **Descriptive link text**: Not "click here" or "this link"

### Admonitions (callouts)

Highlight important information with admonitions. Make sure you use the appropriate type based on the severity and purpose of the message.

  <TabItem label="Note" value="note">
    ```markdown title="Note syntax"
    :::note
    `note` is for information that the user should be aware of but isn't critical.

## Before submitting

### Run automated checks locally (optional)

If you're working locally, run these commands before submitting:

```bash
# Build the documentation
npm run build

# Run style checks (if Vale is installed)
vale docs/
```

Don't worry if you skip theseâ€”the CI/CD pipeline runs them automatically.

### Review your changes

Before creating a pull request:

1. Read your changes out loudâ€”does it make sense?
2. Test any code examples or commands.
3. Check that links work.
4. Verify screenshots are clear and relevant.
5. Make sure formatting looks correct.

### Create a pull request

1. **Title**: Briefly describe what you added. Examples:

   - âœ… `Add troubleshooting guide for browser detection`
   - âœ… `Document file upload action with examples`

2. **Description**: Use the PR template to provide context:

   - What did you add or change?
   - Why is this helpful?
   - Related issue number (if applicable)

3. **Submit**: Create your pull request.

## What happens during review

1. **Automated checks** run (typically 2-5 minutes)
2. **Maintainer reviews** your contribution (within 5 business days)
3. **Feedback or approval**:
   - If changes are needed, update your pull request.
   - If approved, your contribution is merged.

### Understanding automated checks

#### Vale (style checking)

Vale enforces the documentation style guide. Common suggestions include

- Use "you" instead of "the user"
- Avoid "please" in instructions
- Use active voice instead of passive
- Avoid gendered pronouns (use "they")

Most Vale suggestions are just thatâ€”suggestions. Reviewers use judgment.

#### Link validation

Checks that all links work. If this fails,

- Verify external URLs are correct
- Check internal link paths (case-sensitive)
- Make sure linked pages exist

#### Build check

Make sure that the documentation site builds successfully. Failures usually indicate

- Markdown syntax errors
- Missing closing tags
- Invalid front matter

## Need help?

### During writing

- **Not sure about structure?** Check similar pages in the docs.
- **Questions about content or technical details?** Ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF).

### After submitting

- **Automated checks failed?** Check the details in the PRâ€”reviewers can help.
- **No response yet?** Wait 5 business days, then ping in the PR.
- **Need to make changes?** Just commit to the same branchâ€”the PR updates automatically.
