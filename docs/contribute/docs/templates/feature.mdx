# Feature Documentation Template

Use this template to document new features or significant changes to existing features.

## When to use this template

Use feature documentation when:

- A new feature has been added
- An existing feature has changed significantly
- Users need to understand what changed and how to use it
- Migration from old to new behavior is needed

**Examples:**

- New action type added to Doc Detective
- Configuration options changed
- New integration or plugin
- Breaking changes to existing functionality

## Template

Copy and adapt this template for your feature documentation:

````markdown
---
title: [Feature name]
description: [One-sentence description of what this feature does]

## Writing tips

### Lead with benefits

Start with why users should care:

✅ Good:

> The `parallel` option lets you run tests simultaneously, reducing execution time by up to 70% for large test suites.

⛔ Too technical:

> The `parallel` option implements concurrent test execution using worker threads.

### Show before and after

For changes, show both the old and new way:

✅ Good:

> **Before:** You had to manually specify each test file
>
> ```bash
> doc-detective test1.spec.json test2.spec.json test3.spec.json
> ```
>
> **Now:** Use glob patterns to match multiple files
>
> ```bash
> doc-detective "tests/**/*.spec.json"
> ```

### Provide complete examples

Examples should be copy-pasteable and work as-is:

✅ Complete:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "screenshot",
          "path": "screenshot.png",
          "fullPage": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

⛔ Incomplete:

```json
{
  "screenshot": {
    "fullPage": true
  }
}
```

### Document breaking changes

Be explicit about what breaks:

✅ Clear:

> **Breaking change:** The `timeout` option now accepts milliseconds instead of seconds.
>
> **Before:** `"timeout": 30` (30 seconds) **After:** `"timeout": 30000` (30 seconds in milliseconds)
>
> **To update:** Multiply all timeout values by 1000.

### Version your examples

If behavior varies by version:

```markdown
:::info Version differences This feature works differently depending on your Doc Detective version:

**v2.x:** Uses `oldOption` **v3.x and later:** Uses `newOption` :::
```

## Example feature documentation

Here's a complete example:

````markdown
---
title: Screenshot cropping
description: Capture screenshots of specific elements instead of the entire page.
---

# Screenshot cropping

Crop screenshots to specific elements on the page, making it easier to highlight relevant parts of your documentation without capturing unnecessary UI.

## What's new

- `screenshot` action now supports element-based cropping
- New `cropTo` option to specify target element
- Automatic padding around cropped elements
- Works with both CSS selectors and XPath

## Why this matters

When documenting specific features, you often want screenshots that focus on a particular UI element—like a button, form, or menu—without including the entire page. Element-based cropping:

- Creates focused, professional screenshots
- Reduces file size by capturing only what matters
- Automatically updates when UI changes
- Makes documentation clearer and easier to follow

## How to use screenshot cropping

### Basic example

Capture just a specific button:

```json title="screenshot-button.spec.json"
{ "tests": [ { "steps": [ { "action": "goTo", "url": "https://doc-detective.com" }, { "action": "screenshot", "path": "get-started-button.png", "cropTo": { "selector": "a[href='/docs/get-started']" } } ] } ] }
```

This captures only the "Get Started" link, not the entire page.

### Advanced example

Crop to an element with padding:

```json title="screenshot-with-padding.spec.json"
{ "tests": [ { "steps": [ { "action": "goTo", "url": "https://doc-detective.com" }, { "action": "screenshot", "path": "navigation-menu.png", "cropTo": { "selector": "nav.navbar", "padding": 20 } } ] } ] }
```

Adds 20 pixels of padding around the navigation element for context.

## Configuration options

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| path | string | Yes | - | Where to save the screenshot |
| cropTo | object | No | - | Element to crop to (see below) |
| cropTo.selector | string | Yes\* | - | CSS selector or XPath of element |
| cropTo.padding | number | No | 0 | Pixels of padding around element |
| fullPage | boolean | No | false | Ignored if cropTo is specified |

\*Required if `cropTo` is used

### Example configuration

```json title=".doc-detective.json"
{ "tests": [ { "steps": [ { "action": "screenshot", "path": "feature.png", "cropTo": { "selector": "#feature-section", "padding": 15 } } ] } ] }
```

## Migration guide

If you were using full-page screenshots and want to crop:

### From full-page screenshots

```json
{ "action": "screenshot", "path": "page.png", "fullPage": true }
```

### To element-based cropping

```json
{ "action": "screenshot", "path": "element.png", "cropTo": { "selector": "#target-element" } }
```

### Breaking changes

None. This is a backward-compatible addition. Existing screenshots continue to work unchanged.

## Compatibility

- **Minimum version**: Doc Detective 3.1.0
- **Browser support**: All supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Platform support**: All platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Troubleshooting

### Element not found for cropping

**Symptoms:** Error message "Could not find element for cropping"

**Cause:** The selector doesn't match any element on the page

**Solution:**

1. Verify the element exists on the page
2. Use browser dev tools to test your selector
3. Add a `wait` action before screenshot if element loads slowly
4. Try a different selector (ID, class, or XPath)

### Screenshot is too small

**Symptoms:** Cropped screenshot is tiny or cuts off content

**Cause:** Element is smaller than expected or padding is insufficient

**Solution:**

1. Increase the `padding` value
2. Select a parent element that includes more context
3. Verify you're selecting the correct element
