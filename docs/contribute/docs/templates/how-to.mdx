# How-To guide template

Use this template for task-oriented documentation that helps users accomplish a specific goal.

## When to use this template

Use a how-to guide when users:

- Know what they want to accomplish
- Need step-by-step instructions
- Want to complete a specific task
- Already understand basic concepts

Examples:

- How to configure browser settings
- How to run tests in parallel
- How to capture screenshots
- How to use environment variables

## Template

Copy and adapt this template for your how-to guide:

````markdown

title: How to [accomplish task]
description: [One-sentence description of what users will accomplish]
---

# How to [accomplish task]

[One or two sentences explaining what this guide helps users do and why they might want to do it.]

## Before you begin

[List prerequisites and required setup. If none, remove this section.]

- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2
- Prerequisite 3

## Step 1: [First major action]

[Explain what this step accomplishes and why it's necessary.]

[Provide detailed instructions. Use numbered sub-steps if needed.]

```[language] title="[filename if applicable]"
[Code example or command]
```

[Explain what this code does or what to expect.]

## Step 2: [Second major action]

[Continue with subsequent steps, following the same pattern.]

## Step 3: [Third major action]

[Add as many steps as needed to complete the task.]

## Verify it works

[Optional: Provide a way for users to verify they completed the task successfully.]

[What should they see or be able to do?]

## Troubleshooting

[Optional: List common issues and solutions. If none, remove this section.]

### [Problem description]

**Cause:** [Why this happens]

**Solution:** [How to fix it]

### [Another problem]

**Cause:** [Why this happens]

**Solution:** [How to fix it]

## What's next

[Suggest related tasks or next steps. Optional but recommended.]

- [Related task 1](link)
- [Related task 2](link)
- [Learn more about X](link)
````

## Writing tips

### Keep it focused

- **One task per guide**: Don't try to cover multiple unrelated tasks
- **Clear scope**: State what the guide covers (and doesn't cover)
- **Direct instructions**: Get to the steps quickly

### Use clear headings

Step headings should describe actions:

✅ Good:

- Step 1: Configure the test environment
- Step 2: Create the test file
- Step 3: Run your first test

⛔ Avoid:

- Step 1: Configuration
- Step 2: Files
- Step 3: Execution

### Write imperative instructions

Start instructions with action verbs:

✅ Good:

- Click the **Settings** button
- Type `npm install` in the terminal
- Navigate to the config file

⛔ Avoid:

- You should click the Settings button
- The user can type npm install
- It's possible to navigate to the config

### Provide context

Explain why steps are necessary:

✅ Good:

> Create a `.env` file to store configuration values separately from your test code. This makes it easier to use different values for different environments.

⛔ Avoid:

> Create a `.env` file.

### Test your instructions

Before submitting:

1. ✅ Follow your own steps exactly as written
2. ✅ Verify the outcome matches what you documented
3. ✅ Test on a clean environment if possible
4. ✅ Note any assumptions or prerequisites
