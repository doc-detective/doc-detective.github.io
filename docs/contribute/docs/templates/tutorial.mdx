# Tutorial Template

Use this template for learning-oriented documentation that guides users through a complete workflow to build understanding.

## When to use this template

Use a tutorial when users:

- Are learning a new concept or feature
- Need to understand a complete workflow
- Want hands-on practice
- May not know what they don't know yet

**Examples:**

- Create your first Doc Detective test
- Build a complete test suite
- Test a documentation site end-to-end
- Set up automated testing in CI/CD

## Template

Copy and adapt this template for your tutorial:

## Writing tips

### Make it safe to learn

Tutorials are for learning, not reference:

✅ **Do:**

- Explain concepts before showing code
- Provide context for why things work
- Encourage experimentation
- Make failure safe and instructive

⛔ **Don't:**

- Assume prior knowledge
- Skip explanations for brevity
- Punish mistakes
- Jump to advanced topics too quickly

### Build progressively

Each step should build on previous ones:

✅ Good progression:

1. Create a basic test with one action
2. Add a second action to create a flow
3. Add error handling
4. Organize into a test suite

⛔ Poor progression:

1. Create a basic test
2. Deploy to production (too big a jump)

### Explain the why

Users should understand not just _how_ but _why_:

✅ Good:

> Use the `find` action to verify the element exists before interacting with it. This makes tests more reliable by waiting for elements to load.

⛔ Insufficient:

> Use the `find` action.

### Use a friendly tone

Tutorials should be encouraging:

✅ Good:

> Great! You've created your first test. Let's make it more useful by adding another action.

⛔ Too formal:

> The test has been created. Proceed to add additional actions.

### Show the outcome

After each major step, show what users should see:

✅ Good:

> You should now see output like this:
>
> ```
> [PASS] test-1: Passed (2.3s)
> ```
>
> This confirms your test ran successfully.

⛔ Missing:

> Run the test.

### Test your tutorial

Before submitting:

1. Follow the tutorial yourself from scratch
2. Have someone unfamiliar with the topic try it
3. Note where they get stuck or confused
4. Revise based on feedback

# Create your first Doc Detective test

Learn the basics of Doc Detective by creating a simple test that verifies a web page loads and contains expected content. By the end, you'll understand how tests work and be ready to test your own documentation.

## What you'll learn

- How to structure a Doc Detective test file
- The basic actions: `goTo` and `find`
- How to run tests from the command line
- How to interpret test results

## What you'll build

A test that:

1. Navigates to the Doc Detective homepage
2. Verifies the page title appears
3. Confirms a key feature is mentioned

## What you'll need

- Node.js 18 or later installed
- A text editor
- 10 minutes

## Step 1: Create your test file

Doc Detective tests are defined in JSON files with a `.spec.json` extension.

Create a file named `first-test.spec.json`:

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": []
}
```

This is the basic structure. The `tests` array will contain your test definitions.

### Add your first test

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "homepage-check",
      "description": "Verify the Doc Detective homepage loads"
    }
  ]
}
```

Inside the `tests` array, add a test object:

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "homepage-check",
      "description": "Verify the Doc Detective homepage loads"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` uniquely identifies this test, and `description` explains what it does.

:::tip

Use descriptive IDs and descriptions. They help you understand test results and maintain tests over time.

:::

## Step 2: Add actions

Tests contain `steps`—actions that Doc Detective performs. Add a `steps` array:

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "homepage-check",
      "description": "Verify the Doc Detective homepage loads",
      "steps": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigate to a URL

Add a `goTo` action to navigate to the homepage:

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "homepage-check",
      "description": "Verify the Doc Detective homepage loads",
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://doc-detective.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

  The `goTo` action opens a browser and navigates to the specified URL.

### Verify content

Add a `find` action to verify the page title exists:

```json title="first-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "homepage-check",
      "description": "Verify the Doc Detective homepage loads",
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://doc-detective.com"
        },
        {
          "action": "find",
          "selector": "h1",
          "matchText": "Doc Detective"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This finds an `h1` element and verifies it contains "Doc Detective".

## Step 3: Run your test

Run the test using npx:

```bash
npx doc-detective runTests --input first-test.spec.json
```

You should see output like:

```
[INFO] Running test: homepage-check
[INFO] ✓ goTo - Navigated to https://doc-detective.com
[INFO] ✓ find - Found element matching criteria
[PASS] Test completed successfully (3.2s)
```

Success! Your test passed.

## Try it yourself

Modify your test to verify another element on the page:

1. Visit https://doc-detective.com in your browser.
2. Right-click an element and select "Inspect".
3. Note the element's selector.
4. Add another `find` action to your test.
5. Run the test again.

Can you verify that the "Get Started" link exists?

## What you learned

Congratulations! You've created and run your first Doc Detective test. You learned:

- How to structure a test file with tests and steps
- How to use `goTo` to navigate to pages
- How to use `find` to verify content exists
- How to run tests from the command line

## Troubleshooting

### Test fails with "Element not found"

If your `find` action fails, the selector might be incorrect.

To fix,

1. Open the URL in your browser.
2. Right-click the element and select "Inspect".
3. Verify the selector matches the HTML.
4. Try a different selector (class, ID, or text).

### Browser doesn't open

Doc Detective needs a browser to run tests. Make sure:

- You have Chrome, Firefox, or Edge installed
- The browser is up to date
- No other process is using the browser

## Next steps

Now that you understand the basics:

- [Add more actions to your tests](/docs/category/actions)
- [Learn about test contexts](/docs/get-started/config/contexts/)
- [Write tests for your own documentation](/docs/contributing/testing)
