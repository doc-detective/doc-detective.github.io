# Contribute to the docs

Welcome! Doc Detective is better because of contributors like you. Whether you're fixing a typo, adding an example, or writing comprehensive tutorials, your contribution matters.

## Good enough is better than perfect

You don't need to be a technical writer or documentation expert to contribute. If you see something that could be clearer, more accurate, or more helpful, you can improve it. We value accurate information over elegant proseâ€”if you know something that should be documented, share it!

## Before you start

- **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. Everyone is volunteering their time, including both you and the maintainers.
- **CLA Requirement**: Before code or documentation contributions can be merged, you need to sign the [contributor license agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io). This makes sure that your contributions are properly licensed and maintains the project's open-source status.
- **Questions?**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF) to ask questions or discuss your contribution ideas.
