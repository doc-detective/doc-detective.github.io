# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used in Doc Detective documentation.

## Action

A command that Doc Detective performs within a [step](#step) of a test. Actions include tasks like navigating to a URL, clicking an element, or taking a screenshot. See [Actions](/docs/category/actions) for the complete list.

## AsciiDoc

A lightweight markup language for technical documentation. Doc Detective supports AsciiDoc files with inline and detected tests. See [AsciiDoc input format](/docs/get-started/inputs/asciidoc).

## Context

A combination of platform (operating system) and browser where tests run. Contexts can be defined at the config, spec, or test level to control where tests execute. See [Contexts](/docs/get-started/config/contexts).

## CSS selector

A pattern used to select HTML elements on a page. CSS selectors are the recommended way to target elements in Doc Detective tests. See [CSS selectors](/docs/get-started/selectors/css).

## Detected tests

Tests automatically generated by Doc Detective based on your documentation source files. Detected tests use markup patterns to identify testable content. See [Detected tests](/docs/get-started/tests/detected).

## DITA

Darwin Information Typing Architecture, an XML-based format for technical documentation. Doc Detective can extract tests from DITA task topics using semantic markup. See [DITA input format](/docs/get-started/inputs/dita).

## Inline tests

Tests defined directly in documentation source files using specially formatted comments. Inline tests keep test definitions close to the content they validate. See [Inline tests](/docs/get-started/tests/inline).

## Input format

The file format of your documentation source files. Doc Detective supports Markdown, DITA, AsciiDoc, HTML, and custom formats. See [Input formats](/docs/get-started/inputs/overview).

## Markup pattern

A regular expression pattern used to detect testable content in documentation. Markup patterns are defined in the `fileTypes` configuration and enable detected tests. See [Detected tests](/docs/get-started/tests/detected).

## Selector

A pattern used to identify UI elements for interaction in tests. Doc Detective supports CSS selectors and XPath selectors. See [Selectors](/docs/category/selectors).

## Specification

The highest-level component of a test suite, also called a test spec. A specification is a collection of [tests](#test) that should run together and can share configuration. See [Tests overview](/docs/get-started/tests/overview).

## Step

A single action within a [test](#test). Each step performs one action and acts as an assertion that the action completes as expected. See [Tests overview](/docs/get-started/tests/overview).

## Test

A sequence of [steps](#step) to perform as part of a test specification. Each test has a name and a set of steps that validate documentation accuracy. See [Tests overview](/docs/get-started/tests/overview).

## Test specification

See [Specification](#specification).

## XPath selector

An XML path expression used to navigate and select elements in HTML or XML documents. XPath selectors provide more complex element selection than CSS selectors. See [XPath selectors](/docs/get-started/selectors/xpath).
