# Resources

There are a handful of resources to help you write and run tests:

- The [Action Builder](/app) prototype is an interactive tool to help you build test actions, using the same action definitions and validations as Doc Detective itself.
- The [Schemas](/docs/category/schemas) include detailed information about the schemas and actions available in Doc Detective.
- The [Discord](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF) community is a great place to ask questions and get help from other users and the maintainers.
- The [Issue tracker](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/issues) is the best place to report bugs and request new features.
- The [Contribution guide](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/blob/main/CONTRIBUTIONS.md) includes information about how to contribute to the project.
