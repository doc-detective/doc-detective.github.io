# Concepts

Learn the key concepts that form the foundation of Doc Detective.

## Test specification

A [test specification](/docs/references/schemas/specification) is a group of tests to run in one or more contexts. Conceptually parallel to a document.

## Test

A [test](/docs/get-started/tests) is a sequence of steps to perform. Conceptually parallel to a procedure.

## Step

A step is a portion of a test that includes a single action. Conceptually parallel to a step in a procedure.

## Action

An action is the task performed in a step. Doc Detective supports a variety of actions:

| Name                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                               |
