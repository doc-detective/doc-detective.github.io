# Set up your test environment

You can use Doc Detective directly against your production site. For testing, it's often useful to set up a local HTML server to run your tests. There are many server options. Live Server is a free utility that creates a local server that monitors your files for changes and updates the browser window automatically.

1. Download [TestExamples.zip](./TestExamples.zip) and expand the file to your local disk.
1. In a terminal, navigate to the expanded folder:

   ```shell
   cd <path-to-expanded-test-examples>
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-expanded-test-examples>` with the actual path where you expanded the `TestExamples.zip` file.
1. Install and run a webserver. Running your tests against a local server allows you to make edits and see them in real time. Also, you need to serve the files in a web browser to experiment with video recording and other features.

   Any web server will do, but here are a few easy options (unassociated with Doc Detective):

   <Tabs>
      <TabItem value='python' label='Python'>
         To run a local server with Python, you can use the built-in `http.server` module:

         ```bash
         python -m http.server 8080
         ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value='node' label='Node.js'>
         To run a local server with Node.js, you can use the `http-server` package:

         ```bash
         npx http-server <path-to-expanded-test-examples>
         ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value='vscode' label='VSCode'>
         In VSCode, search for and install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension. It gives you a local development server with live reload capability.

         :::info
         You need to set the port number to `8080` in your VSCode settings to match the Doc Detective tutorials.
         :::
      </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Once the server is started, you can open a browser window to `http://localhost:8080`. If you see a rendered page, you're ready to start testing!
