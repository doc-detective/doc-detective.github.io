# goTo

The `goTo` action navigates the browser to a specified URL. This is typically used to start a test at a specific page or navigate between pages during a test.

You can specify the target URL directly as a string, or use an object for more options:

- **String Shorthand:** Provide the full URL, a path (starting with `/`), or a variable reference directly as the value for the `goTo` key. If a path is provided, it navigates relative to the current URL or the global `origin` if set in the configuration.
- **Object Format:** Use an object with the following properties:
  - `url`: (Required) The URL to navigate to. Can be a full URL, a path, or a variable reference.
  - `origin`: (Optional) Protocol and domain prepended to `url` when `url` is a path. Overrides the global `origin` if set.

> For comprehensive options, see the [`goTo`](/docs/references/schemas/goto) reference.

## Examples

Here are a few ways you might use the `goTo` action:

### Navigate to a full URL (string shorthand)

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to example.com.",
          "goTo": "https://example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigate to a relative path (string shorthand)

Assumes the browser is currently at `https://example.com` or a global `origin` is set.

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to the /about path.",
          "goTo": "/about"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigate using an object with a full URL

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to example.com using object format.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "https://example.com"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigate using an object with a relative path and specific origin

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to Google search using a specific origin.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "/search",
            "origin": "https://www.google.com"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Wait conditions

The `goTo` action supports a `wait` property to configure waiting conditions after navigation. This helps ensure pages are fully loaded and ready before the next step runs.

The `wait` property is an object with the following properties:

- `timeout`: (Optional) Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for all conditions to be met. If exceeded, the goTo action fails (default: 30000).
- `networkIdleTime`: (Optional) Wait for network activity to be idle (no new requests) for this duration in milliseconds. Set to `null` to skip this check (default: 500).
- `domIdleTime`: (Optional) Wait for DOM mutations to stop for this duration in milliseconds. Set to `null` to skip this check (default: 1000).
- `find`: (Optional) Wait for a specific element to be present in the DOM. At least one of `selector` or `elementText` must be specified.
  - `selector`: (Optional) CSS selector for the element to wait for.
  - `elementText`: (Optional) Text content the element must contain.

### Wait for network idle

Navigate to a page and wait for network activity to settle.

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate and wait for network idle.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "https://www.example.com",
            "wait": {
              "networkIdleTime": 500
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Wait for a specific element

Navigate to a dashboard and wait for a specific element to appear.

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to dashboard and wait for it to load.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "https://www.example.com/dashboard",
            "wait": {
              "find": {
                "selector": "[data-testid='dashboard-loaded']"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Wait for element with text

Wait for an element containing specific text to appear.

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to status page and wait for operational message.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "https://www.example.com/status",
            "wait": {
              "find": {
                "elementText": "System operational"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Combine multiple wait conditions

Use multiple wait conditions together with a custom timeout.

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Navigate to app with comprehensive wait conditions.",
          "goTo": {
            "url": "https://www.example.com/app",
            "wait": {
              "timeout": 60000,
              "networkIdleTime": 500,
              "domIdleTime": 1000,
              "find": {
                "selector": ".main-content",
                "elementText": "Dashboard"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
