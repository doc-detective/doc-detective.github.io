# dragAndDrop

The `dragAndDrop` action allows you to drag an element and drop it at a target location. This is useful for testing drag-and-drop interfaces, reordering lists, moving items between containers, and other interactive UI elements.

The `dragAndDrop` action requires both a source and target element, which can be specified using element text, CSS/XPath selectors, or detailed objects with additional configuration options.

## Use Cases

The `dragAndDrop` action is particularly useful for testing:

- **Kanban boards**: Moving tasks between different status columns
- **File uploads**: Dragging files from desktop to upload areas
- **List reordering**: Changing the order of items in sortable lists
- **Dashboard widgets**: Rearranging components on customizable dashboards
- **Form builders**: Moving form elements between different sections
- **Shopping carts**: Adding items by dragging them to the cart area

## Properties

The `dragAndDrop` action requires an object with the following properties:

- `source`: (Required) The element to drag from. Can be a string (element text or selector) or a detailed object.
- `target`: (Required) The element to drop onto. Can be a string (element text or selector) or a detailed object.

### Source and Target Element Properties

When using detailed objects for `source` or `target`, you can specify:

- `elementText`: (Optional) Display text of the element. If combined with `selector`, the element must match both the text and the selector.
- `selector`: (Optional) CSS or XPath selector of the element. If combined with `elementText`, the element must match both the text and the selector.
- `timeout`: (Optional) Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for this specific element to exist.

## Examples

Here are several ways you might use the `dragAndDrop` action:

### Drag and drop using selectors or element text

```json

    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Drag 'Item 1' and drop it onto 'Drop Zone'",
          "dragAndDrop": {
            "source": "#source-list .draggable-item:first-child",
            "target": "Drop Zone"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Drag and drop with detailed element objects

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "description": "Drag a specific task to a different column",
          "dragAndDrop": {
            "source": {
              "selector": ".task-card",
              "elementText": "Complete documentation"
            },
            "target": {
              "selector": ".column",
              "elementText": "In Progress"
