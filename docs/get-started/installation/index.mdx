# Installation

Downloading and running Doc Detective is straightforward. Follow these steps to install Doc Detective and run your first test:

1. Install prerequisites:

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later

2. In a terminal, install Doc Detective globally:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" title="Install Doc Detective">
      npm i -g doc-detective
    </CodeBlock>
    {/* step runShell: "npm i -g doc-detective" */}

    :::note

    If you're working in a local copy of the `doc-detective` repository, you need to run `npm i` to install local dependencies.

    :::

3.  Save this file to your current directory as _sample.spec.json_:

    <CodeBlock language="json" title="sample.spec.json">
      {JSON.stringify(spec, null, 2)}
    </CodeBlock>

4. Run a test, pointing to the file you just created:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" title="Run test">
      npx doc-detective --input sample.spec.json
    </CodeBlock>
    {/* step runShell:
    command: "npx doc-detective --input sample.spec.json"
    workingDirectory: "." */}


Congratulations! You've run your first test with Doc Detective. :tada:

You should see output in the terminal indicating the progress and results of the test. Results are also saved in a `testResults-<timestamp>.json` file in the current directory (configurable with the `--output` option), and this test saves a screenshot to example.png:

## Environment Variables

You can customize Doc Detective's behavior with environment variables.

### DOC_DETECTIVE_API_URL

Override the default Doc Detective API endpoint. Use this for enterprise or custom API deployments.

Default: `https://api.doc-detective.com/v1`

Set the environment variable before running tests:

```bash
export DOC_DETECTIVE_API_URL=https://custom-api.example.com/v1
npx doc-detective --input sample.spec.json
```

This variable only works when you've set an API key with `integrations.docDetectiveApi.apiKey` in your config. When you set an API key, Doc Detective runs tests via the API instead of locally.

For more information, see the [configuration reference](/docs/references/schemas/config) and [integrations options](/docs/references/schemas/integrations-options).
