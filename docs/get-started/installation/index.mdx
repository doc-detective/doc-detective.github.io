# Installation

Downloading and running Doc Detective is straightforward. You can install Doc Detective using NPX (Node.js) or Docker. Follow the instructions for your preferred method:

Choose *NPX* if you have Node.js installed and want to install Doc Detective on your machine locally. Choose *Docker* if you can't install applications locally, prefer containerized environments, need to avoid Node.js installation, or want to isolate Doc Detective from your system.

1. Install prerequisites:

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later

2. In a terminal, install Doc Detective globally:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" title="Install Doc Detective">
      npm i -g doc-detective
    </CodeBlock>
    {/* step runShell: "npm i -g doc-detective" */}

    :::note

    If you're working in a local copy of the `doc-detective` repository, you need to run `npm i` to install local dependencies.

3.  Save this file to your current directory as _sample.spec.json_:

    <CodeBlock language="json" title="sample.spec.json">
      {JSON.stringify(spec, null, 2)}
    </CodeBlock>

4. Run a test, pointing to the file you just created:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" title="Run test">
      npx doc-detective --input sample.spec.json
    </CodeBlock>
    {/* step runShell:
    command: "npx doc-detective --input sample.spec.json"
    workingDirectory: "." */}

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

1. Install prerequisites:

    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    {/* step checkLink: "https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" */}

2. Save this file to your current directory as _sample.spec.json_:

    <CodeBlock language="json" title="sample.spec.json">
      {JSON.stringify(spec, null, 2)}
    </CodeBlock>

3. Run a test, pointing to the file you just created:

    <CodeBlock language="bash" title="Run test">
      docker run -v .:/app docdetective/docdetective --input /app/sample.spec.json
    </CodeBlock>
    {/* step runShell:
    command: "docker run -v .:/app docdetective/docdetective --input /app/sample.spec.json"
    workingDirectory: "." */}

    :::note

    The `-v` argument mounts your current directory (`.`) to `/app` in the container, giving Doc Detective access to your test specification and enabling it to output results and screenshots. If your test specification is hosted at an HTTPS URL, the `-v` argument is not necessary.

Congratulations! You've run your first test with Doc Detective. :tada:

You should see output in the terminal indicating the progress and results of the test. Results are also saved in a `testResults-<timestamp>.json` file in the current directory (configurable with the `--output` option), and this test saves a screenshot to example.png:
