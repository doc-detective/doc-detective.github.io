# Substantial contributions (30+ minutes)

Major documentation projects that significantly expand or improve the Doc Detective documentation.

## What counts as substantial

- Documenting new features or major changes
- Writing complete tutorials from scratch
- Major restructuring of existing documentation
- Creating comprehensive reference documentation
- Large-scale content updates (multiple pages)
- Adding new documentation categories

## Before you start

For substantial contributions, it's important to align with maintainers before investing significant time:

1. **Check for existing issues**: Look for [documentation issues](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation) or feature requests
2. **Open a discussion**: If no issue exists, open one describing your plans
3. **Get feedback**: Wait for maintainer input before starting major work
4. **Claim the work**: Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

This prevents duplicate effort and ensures your contribution aligns with project goals.

## Required: Local development environment

Substantial contributions require a local development environment to efficiently work across multiple files and see real-time previews.

ðŸ‘‰ See [Local Development Setup](local-development) for detailed instructions

Quick setup:
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/doc-detective.github.io.git
cd doc-detective.github.io

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm run start
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:3000` with live reload.

## Plan your contribution

### Understand the user journey

Before writing, consider:
- **Who** is the target audience?
- **What** are they trying to accomplish?
- **Why** would they read this documentation?
- **When** in their journey will they need this?

### Choose the right content type

Use templates to structure your content:

#### Tutorial
**Purpose**: Guide users through learning a concept end-to-end

**Use when**: Users need to understand a complete workflow or feature

ðŸ‘‰ [Tutorial template](templates/tutorial)

#### How-to guide
**Purpose**: Help users accomplish a specific task

**Use when**: Users know what they want to do but need instructions

ðŸ‘‰ [How-to template](templates/how-to)

#### Reference
**Purpose**: Provide technical specifications and details

**Use when**: Users need to look up specific information

ðŸ‘‰ [Reference template](templates/reference)

#### Feature documentation
**Purpose**: Document what changed and how to use new functionality

**Use when**: A feature is new or has changed significantly

ðŸ‘‰ [Feature template](templates/feature)

### Outline your content

Create an outline before writing:

```markdown
# Title

## Overview
- What this feature/concept is
- Why it matters

## Before you begin
- Prerequisites
- Required setup

## Main content sections
- Section 1: Core concept/action
- Section 2: Next concept/action
- Section 3: Additional details

## Examples
- Basic example
- Advanced example

## Troubleshooting (if applicable)
- Common issue 1
- Common issue 2

## What's next
- Related topics
- Next steps
```

Share your outline in the issue for early feedback.

## Writing substantial documentation

### Start with an outline

Get feedback on structure before writing full content:

1. Create a draft with section headings and bullet points
2. Commit and push to your branch
3. Open a draft pull request marked "WIP" or "Draft"
4. Request feedback on structure

This prevents rewrites later.

### Write incrementally

Don't try to write everything at once:

1. **Write one section**: Complete a single logical section
2. **Commit and push**: Save your progress
3. **Review locally**: Read it fresh after a break
4. **Move to next section**: Repeat the process

Commit often with clear messages:
- `Add overview section to feature X documentation`
- `Document basic example for Y tutorial`
- `Add troubleshooting section for Z`

### Include comprehensive examples

Substantial documentation needs examples users can learn from:

#### Basic example
Show the simplest use case:

```json title="basic-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://doc-detective.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Advanced example
Show real-world usage with more complexity:

```json title="advanced-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "login-flow",
      "description": "Verify user can log in and access dashboard",
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://example.com/login"
        },
        {
          "action": "find",
          "selector": "#username"
        },
        {
          "action": "type",
          "keys": "$USERNAME"
        },
        {
          "action": "type",
          "selector": "#password",
          "keys": "$PASSWORD"
        },
        {
          "action": "click",
          "selector": "button[type='submit']"
        },
        {
          "action": "find",
          "selector": ".dashboard",
          "matchText": "Welcome"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add visual aids

Consider adding:
- **Diagrams**: Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for flowcharts and diagrams
- **Screenshots**: Show key UI elements or results
- **Videos**: For complex workflows (link to hosted videos)

Example Mermaid diagram:

```markdown
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Write docs] --> B[Add tests];
    B --> C[Run tests];
    C --> D{Tests pass?};
    D -->|Yes| E[Deploy];
    D -->|No| A;
\`\`\`
```

### Cross-link related content

Help users discover related information:

- Link to prerequisites
- Reference related actions or concepts
- Provide "What's next" suggestions
- Link to troubleshooting if applicable

## Testing your documentation

### Build locally

Ensure the site builds without errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

Fix any build errors before submitting.

### Test your examples

Every code example should be tested:

1. **Run the code**: Verify examples work as shown
2. **Test variations**: Ensure options are documented correctly
3. **Check edge cases**: Document limitations if found

### Doc Detective tests

If your documentation includes testable procedures, consider adding Doc Detective tests:

```json title="your-feature.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "test-your-documentation",
      "description": "Verify the documented procedure works",
      "steps": [
        // Add steps that follow your documentation
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Place test files in the same directory as the documentation they test.

ðŸ‘‰ See [Testing Guide](testing) for details on writing Doc Detective tests

## Review process for substantial contributions

### Initial review

Expect more detailed feedback on substantial contributions:

1. **Technical accuracy**: Is the information correct?
2. **Content organization**: Is the structure logical?
3. **Completeness**: Are there gaps that need filling?
4. **Examples**: Are they clear and correct?
5. **Writing quality**: Is it clear and concise?

### Iterative improvement

Don't expect to get it perfect on the first try:

1. **Address feedback**: Make requested changes
2. **Ask questions**: If feedback is unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Suggest alternatives**: If you disagree, explain your reasoning
4. **Iterate**: Multiple review rounds are normal

### Technical writer involvement

For substantial contributions, a technical writer may:
- Provide structural feedback
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Help with clarity and consistency
- Polish language and formatting

This is collaborativeâ€”your subject matter expertise plus writing expertise produces the best documentation.
