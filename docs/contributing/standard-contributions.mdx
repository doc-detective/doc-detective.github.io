# Standard contributions (10-30 minutes)

Add new content, examples, and improvements to the documentation. You can work in your browser or set up a local development environment.

## What counts as a standard contribution

- Adding missing steps to tutorials
- Providing code examples
- Adding troubleshooting tips
- Creating FAQ entries
- Adding "See also" links
- Expanding brief explanations
- Adding diagrams or screenshots

## Two ways to work

### Option 1: Browser-based (easier)

Use GitHub's web editor for smaller additions:

1. Click "Edit this page" on any doc page
2. Make your changes using the web editor
3. Commit and create a pull request

**Good for:** Adding a few paragraphs, code examples, or list items

### Option 2: Local development (more powerful)

Set up a local environment to preview changes as you write:

üëâ See [Local Development Setup](local-development) for detailed instructions

**Good for:** Adding multiple sections, working across multiple files, or seeing live previews

## Using content templates

Templates help you structure your contribution and ensure you include all the important information.

Choose the template that matches what you're creating:

- **[How-to guide](templates/how-to)**: Task-focused step-by-step instructions
- **[Tutorial](templates/tutorial)**: Learning-oriented guide through a complete workflow
- **[Troubleshooting entry](templates/troubleshooting)**: Problem-solution format
- **[Reference](templates/reference)**: Technical specifications or API documentation
- **[Feature documentation](templates/feature)**: Document a new or changed feature

## Content guidelines

### Structure your content

Use clear headings to organize information:

```markdown
## Before you begin

Prerequisites and setup information

## Step 1: First major action

Detailed instructions

## Step 2: Next major action

More instructions

## What's next

Related topics and next steps
```

### Write clear instructions

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use second person ("you") and active voice
- Start steps with action verbs: "Click", "Type", "Navigate"
- Put conditions before instructions: "If you want to save, click **Save**"
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use first person ("we") or passive voice
- Start steps with "Now" or "Then"
- Bury conditions in the middle of instructions
- Mix ordered and unordered lists

### Code examples

Always test code examples before submitting:

````markdown
```json title="example-test.spec.json"
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "goTo",
          "url": "https://doc-detective.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Include:
- **Language identifier**: json, bash, typescript, etc.
- **File name** (optional): Use `title="filename.ext"`
- **Context**: Explain what the code does before showing it

### Links and references

Link to related documentation:

```markdown
See [Actions](/docs/category/actions) for available test actions.
```

Use:
- **Absolute paths** for internal links: `/docs/path/to/page`
- **HTTPS** for external links: `https://example.com`
- **Descriptive link text**: Not "click here" or "this link"

### Admonitions (callouts)

Highlight important information:

```markdown
:::tip
Doc Detective can automatically detect tests in your documentation!
:::

:::warning
Make sure to close all browser instances before running tests.
:::

:::info
You can use either JSON or YAML format for test specifications.
:::
```

Available types: `note`, `tip`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`

## Before submitting

### Run automated checks locally (optional)

If you're working locally, run these commands before submitting:

```bash
# Build the documentation
npm run build

# Run style checks (if Vale is installed)
vale docs/
```

Don't worry if you skip these‚Äîthe CI/CD pipeline runs them automatically.

### Review your changes

Before creating a pull request:

1. ‚úÖ Read your changes out loud‚Äîdoes it make sense?
2. ‚úÖ Test any code examples or commands
3. ‚úÖ Check that links work
4. ‚úÖ Verify screenshots are clear and relevant
5. ‚úÖ Make sure formatting looks correct

### Create a pull request

1. **Title**: Briefly describe what you added
   - ‚úÖ `Add troubleshooting guide for browser detection`
   - ‚úÖ `Document file upload action with examples`
   - ‚ùå `Update docs`

2. **Description**: Use the PR template to provide context
   - What did you add or change?
   - Why is this helpful?
   - Related issue number (if applicable)

3. **Submit**: Click "Create pull request"

## What happens during review

1. **Automated checks** run (typically 2-5 minutes)
2. **Maintainer reviews** your contribution (within 5 business days)
3. **Feedback or approval**:
   - If changes are needed, update your pull request
   - If approved, your contribution is merged!

### Understanding automated checks

#### Vale (style checking)

Vale enforces the Google Developer Style Guide. Common suggestions:

- Use "you" instead of "the user"
- Avoid "please" in instructions
- Use active voice instead of passive
- Avoid gendered pronouns (use "they")

Most Vale suggestions are just that‚Äîsuggestions. Reviewers use judgment.

#### Link validation

Checks that all links work. If this fails:
- Verify external URLs are correct
- Check internal link paths (case-sensitive)
- Make sure linked pages exist

#### Build check

Ensures the documentation site builds successfully. Failures usually indicate:
- Markdown syntax errors
- Missing closing tags
- Invalid front matter

## Need help?

- **Questions about content?** Ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF)
- **Stuck on technical details?** Reference the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io/blob/main/AGENTS.md) file

### After submitting
- **Automated checks failed?** Check the details in the PR‚Äîreviewers can help
- **No response yet?** Wait 5 business days, then ping in the PR
- **Need to make changes?** Just commit to the same branch‚Äîthe PR updates automatically
