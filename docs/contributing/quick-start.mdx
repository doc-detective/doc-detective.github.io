# Quick changes (2-10 minutes)

Fix typos, broken links, and small issues directly in your browser—no setup required.

## What you can fix quickly

- Typos and grammar issues
- Confusing wording or unclear instructions
- Missing punctuation or formatting issues

## How to make quick edits

Every documentation page has an **Edit this page** link at the bottom. This is the fastest way to contribute.

1. __Find the issue__: Navigate to the page with the problem.
2. __Open the editor__: Click **Edit this page**, located at the bottom of every doc page.

   GitHub opens the file in a web-based editor.

3. __Make your changes__: Edit the Markdown file directly in the browser to fix the issue.
4. __Preview your changes__: Open a preview panel (Ctrl+Shift+V) to see how it looks.
5. __Commit your changes__:
   1. In the side panel, click the **Source Control** button (looks like a branch icon).
   1. Add a brief description of what you changed (for example, "Fix typo in installation steps").
   1. Click "Commit & Push".
6. __Create a pull request__:
   1. Review the changes one more time.
   1. In the Source Control panel, click the **Create Pull Request** button (looks like a vertical line with dots on both ends with an arrow pointing to the top and a plus sign).
   1. Enter a name and description for the pull request.
   1. Click **Create** to submit.

That's it! A maintainer will review your contribution.

## Tips for quick contributions

### Writing commit messages

Keep them short and descriptive:

✅ Good examples:
- `Fix typo in quick-start guide`
- `Update broken link to API reference`
- `Clarify installation prerequisites`

⛔ Avoid:
- `Update docs`
- `Fix stuff`
- `Changes`

### Making multiple edits

If you're fixing several small issues on the same page, you can make all the changes in one pull request. Just edit the file multiple times before creating the pull request.

For one issue across multiple pages, include all changes in a single pull request.

For different issues across different pages, create separate pull requests—it's faster for reviewers.

## What happens next

1. __Automated checks__: Our CI/CD pipeline runs automated checks on your contribution
   - Style checks (Vale)
   - Link validation
   - Build verification
2. __Review__: A maintainer reviews your changes (usually within 2 business days)
3. __Feedback__: If changes are needed, the reviewer will comment on your pull request
4. __Merge__: Once approved, your contribution is merged and goes live!

## Common contributor concerns (and why you don't need to worry)

### Do I need to test my changes?

For quick fixes like typos and link updates, no testing is required. The automated checks catch most issues.

### What if the automated checks fail?

Don't worry! The reviewer will help you fix any issues. Most common failures are easily correctable:
- __Vale failures__: Usually suggest alternative wording (often just suggestions)
- __Link check failures__: Means a link is broken or inaccessible
- __Build failures__: Usually means there's a syntax error in Markdown

### Can I edit multiple pages at once?

Yes, but it's easier through local development. For small edits across multiple pages, consider creating separate pull requests—it's faster for both you and reviewers.

### Do I need to sign anything?

Yes, but only once. Before your first contribution can be merged, you'll be prompted to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io). This is a one-time process that happens automatically when you create your first pull request.
