# Quick contributions (2-10 minutes)

Fix typos, broken links, and small issues directly in your browser—no setup required.

## What you can fix quickly

- Typos and grammar issues
- Confusing wording or unclear instructions
- Missing punctuation or formatting issues

## How to make quick edits

Every documentation page has an **Edit this page** link at the bottom. This is the fastest way to contribute.

1. **Find the issue**: Navigate to the page with the problem.
2. **Click "Edit this page"**: Located at the bottom of every doc page.

   GitHub opens the file in a web-based editor.

3. **Make your changes**: Edit the Markdown file directly in the browser to fix the issue.
4. **Preview your changes**: Open a preview panel (Ctrl+Shift+V) to see how it looks.
5. **Commit your changes**:
   1. In the side panel, click the **Source control** button (looks like a branch icon).
   1. Add a brief description of what you changed (e.g., "Fix typo in installation steps").
   1. Click "Commit & Push".
6. **Create a pull request**:
   1. Review the changes one more time.
   1. Click "Create pull request".
   1. Add any additional context if needed.
   1. Click "Create pull request" again to submit.

That's it! A maintainer will review your contribution.

## Tips for quick contributions

### Writing commit messages

Keep them short and descriptive:

✅ Good examples:
- `Fix typo in quick-start guide`
- `Update broken link to API reference`
- `Clarify installation prerequisites`

❌ Avoid:
- `Update docs`
- `Fix stuff`
- `Changes`

### Making multiple edits

If you're fixing several small issues on the same page, you can make all the changes in one pull request. Just edit the file multiple times before clicking "Propose changes."

For issues across different pages, create separate pull requests—it's faster for reviewers.

## What happens next

1. **Automated checks**: Our CI/CD pipeline runs automated checks on your contribution
   - Style checks (Vale)
   - Link validation
   - Build verification
2. **Review**: A maintainer reviews your changes (usually within 2 business days)
3. **Feedback**: If changes are needed, the reviewer will comment on your pull request
4. **Merge**: Once approved, your contribution is merged and goes live!

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to test my changes?

For quick fixes like typos and link updates, no testing is required. The automated checks catch most issues.

### What if the automated checks fail?

Don't worry! The reviewer will help you fix any issues. Most common failures are easily correctable:
- **Vale failures**: Usually suggest alternative wording (often just suggestions)
- **Link check failures**: Means a link is broken or inaccessible
- **Build failures**: Usually means there's a syntax error in Markdown

### Can I edit multiple pages at once?

Yes, but it's easier through local development. For small edits across multiple pages, consider creating separate pull requests—it's faster for both you and reviewers.

### Do I need to sign anything?

Yes, but only once. Before your first contribution can be merged, you'll be prompted to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io). This is a one-time process that happens automatically when you create your first pull request.
