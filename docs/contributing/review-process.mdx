# Review process

Understand what happens after you submit a pull request and how to navigate the review process.

## Timeline expectations

We strive to provide timely feedback:

- **Initial response**: Within 2 business days
- **Complete review**: Within 5 business days for standard contributions
- **Expedited review**: Within 24 hours for critical fixes

**Critical fixes** include:
- Security documentation issues
- Incorrect information that could break user workflows
- Broken links to essential resources
- Major accessibility issues

If you don't receive a response within these timeframes, feel free to:
- Comment on the PR asking for an update
- Ping `@doc-detective/maintainers` in the PR
- Ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF)

## Automated checks

Before human review, automated checks verify your contribution.

### What runs automatically

1. **Vale (style checking)**: Checks adherence to Google Developer Style Guide
2. **Build verification**: Ensures the site builds successfully
3. **Link validation**: Verifies all links work
4. **CLA check**: Confirms you've signed the Contributor License Agreement

### Check status indicators

In your pull request, you'll see status checks:

- âœ… **Green check**: Passed
- â›” **Red X**: Failed
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow circle**: Running

### If checks fail

Don't panic! Failed checks are common and usually easy to fix.

#### Vale failures

Vale checks writing style. Common issues:

**"Use second person instead of first person"**
- â›” `We recommend using...`
- âœ… `Use...` or `You can use...`

**"Avoid using 'please' in instructions"**
- â›” `Please click the button`
- âœ… `Click the button`

**"Use active voice"**
- â›” `The file can be uploaded by...`
- âœ… `Upload the file by...`

**Handling Vale suggestions:**
- **Errors**: Should be fixed
- **Warnings**: Strongly consider fixing
- **Suggestions**: Optionalâ€”reviewers use judgment

If you disagree with a Vale suggestion, explain why in a comment. Reviewers can override automated checks when it makes sense.

#### Build failures

Usually indicate syntax errors:

**Common causes:**
- Unclosed code blocks (missing closing ` ``` `)
- Invalid front matter (YAML syntax errors)
- Broken Markdown syntax
- Missing closing tags in JSX

**How to fix:**
1. Check the error message for the specific file and line number
2. Fix the syntax error
3. If working locally, run `npm run build` to verify
4. Commit and push the fix

#### Link validation failures

Means a link is broken or inaccessible:

**Common causes:**
- Typo in URL
- Link to a page that doesn't exist yet
- External site is temporarily down
- Case sensitivity issue in path

**How to fix:**
1. Check the error message for which link failed
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. For internal links, ensure the file exists at that path
4. For external links, verify the site is accessible

#### CLA check failure

You need to sign the Contributor License Agreement:

1. Click the CLA check in your PR
2. Follow the prompts to sign
3. The check automatically re-runs after signing

## Human review

After automated checks pass, a maintainer reviews your contribution.

### What reviewers check

#### âœ… Technical accuracy

Is the information correct?

- Code examples work as shown
- Steps produce expected results
- Claims are accurate
- Links point to correct resources

#### âœ… User value

Does this serve users well?

- Addresses a real user need
- Fits the intended user journey
- Is discoverable when needed
- Clear and understandable

#### âœ… Completeness

Does it cover what's needed?

- Prerequisites are listed
- Steps are complete
- Examples are sufficient
- Related content is linked

#### âœ… Consistency

Does it match existing documentation?

- Similar structure to comparable pages
- Consistent terminology
- Follows established patterns
- Proper formatting

### What reviewers DON'T block on

#### â›” Perfect prose

We value clear communication over elegant writing. If the meaning is clear, it's good enough.

#### â›” Comprehensive edge cases

Documentation doesn't need to cover every possible scenario. Focus on common use cases.

#### â›” Advanced formatting

Basic formatting is sufficient. Fancy design elements are nice-to-have, not required.

#### â›” Minor style issues

If automated tools miss something minor, reviewers won't block on it. We fix small things during review.

## Types of feedback

### Blocking feedback

Must be addressed before merging:

- **Incorrect information**: Technical errors that could mislead users
- **Missing critical steps**: Gaps that make instructions unusable
- **Broken links**: Links that don't work
- **Build failures**: Syntax errors preventing deployment

**How to respond:**
- Fix the issue
- Commit and push changes
- Reply to the comment explaining what you fixed

### Non-blocking suggestions

Optional improvements:

- **Better phrasing**: Alternative wording that might be clearer
- **Additional examples**: Nice-to-have but not required
- **Related content**: Suggestions for future enhancements
- **Style suggestions**: Minor improvements to match conventions

**How to respond:**
- Make the change if you agree
- Or explain why you prefer your approach
- Or note it for future improvement

### Questions

Reviewer needs clarification:

- "Why did you choose this approach?"
- "Can you explain what this code does?"
- "Is this the recommended method?"

**How to respond:**
- Answer the question in a comment
- Consider if the documentation should include this clarification
- Update the docs if the question reveals a gap

## Responding to feedback

### Be collaborative

Remember, reviewers want to help you succeed:

- **Ask questions**: If feedback is unclear, ask for clarification
- **Explain reasoning**: If you disagree, explain your perspective
- **Suggest alternatives**: Propose different solutions if needed
- **Thank reviewers**: Appreciate their time and expertise

### Making changes

1. **Make requested changes** in your local branch
2. **Commit with descriptive messages**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/path/to/file.mdx
   git commit -m "Address review feedback: clarify prerequisites"
   ```
3. **Push to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
4. **Reply to comments**: Let reviewer know you've addressed their feedback

The pull request automatically updates with your new commits.

### Re-requesting review

After addressing feedback:

1. **Resolve conversations**: Click "Resolve conversation" on addressed comments
2. **Leave unresolved**: Keep conversations open if you have questions
3. **Re-request review**: Click "Re-request review" from the reviewer

### If you disagree

It's okay to disagree with feedback:

1. **Explain your reasoning**: Why you prefer your approach
2. **Provide evidence**: Link to examples or documentation supporting your view
3. **Suggest compromise**: Offer an alternative solution
4. **Be open**: The reviewer might have context you don't

Most disagreements resolve through discussion.
