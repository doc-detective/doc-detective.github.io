## Writing tips

### Start with symptoms, not causes

Users search for what they see, not why it happens:

✅ Good:
> # Tests fail with "Element not found"
> 
> ## Symptoms
> - Tests pass locally but fail in CI
> - Error message: `Error: Element with selector "#username" not found`

❌ Less findable:
> # Timing issues in CI environments
> (Users don't search for "timing issues")

### Use exact error messages

Help users find solutions by matching error text:

✅ Searchable:
> Error message: `ECONNREFUSED: Connection refused at http://localhost:3000`

❌ Less useful:
> Error message about connection

### Provide concrete steps

Avoid vague instructions:

✅ Specific:
> 1. Open `.doc-detective.json`
> 2. Add `"timeout": 10000` to the test configuration
> 3. Save the file and run tests again

❌ Vague:
> Increase the timeout value in your configuration

### Show before and after

When changing configuration, show both states:

✅ Clear:
> **Before:**
> ```json
> {"timeout": 5000}
> ```
>
> **After:**
> ```json
> {"timeout": 10000}
> ```

### Explain why solutions work

Help users understand, don't just give commands:

✅ Educational:
> Increase the timeout to 10000ms (10 seconds) to give the page more time to load. CI environments are often slower than local machines.

❌ Just commands:
> Set timeout to 10000.

title: Browser doesn't launch when running tests
description: Resolve issues where Doc Detective fails to open a browser.
---

# Browser doesn't launch when running tests

Tests fail immediately without opening a browser window, preventing Doc Detective from executing any actions.

## Symptoms

- Tests fail with error: `Error: Failed to launch browser`
- No browser window appears
- Error may include: `Could not find Chrome executable`
- Tests work on some machines but not others

## Cause

Doc Detective can't locate or launch the browser for several reasons:

1. **No browser installed**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge isn't installed
2. **Browser not in PATH**: Browser is installed but not in system PATH
3. **Permissions issue**: Doc Detective doesn't have permission to launch the browser
4. **Conflicting browser process**: Another process is interfering with browser launch
5. **Incorrect browser specified**: Configuration specifies a browser that's not available

## Solution

### Step 1: Verify browser is installed

Check that you have a supported browser:

\`\`\`bash
# Check Chrome
google-chrome --version  # Linux
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --version  # Windows
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --version  # macOS

# Check Firefox
firefox --version

# Check Edge
msedge --version
\`\`\`

If the command fails, install a supported browser:
- **Chrome**: https://www.google.com/chrome/
- **Firefox**: https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/
- **Edge**: https://www.microsoft.com/edge

### Step 2: Specify browser explicitly

Add browser configuration to `.doc-detective.json`:

\`\`\`json title=".doc-detective.json"
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "app": {
        "browser": "chrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Valid values: `"chrome"`, `"firefox"`, `"edge"`

### Step 3: Restart your terminal

Close and reopen your terminal, then try again:

\`\`\`bash
npx doc-detective runTests
\`\`\`

## Verify the fix

Run a simple test:

\`\`\`bash
npx doc-detective runTests --input your-test.spec.json
\`\`\`

You should see:
1. A browser window opens
2. Test executes normally
3. Browser closes after test completes

## Alternative solutions

### Option 1: Use a different browser

If one browser doesn't work, try another:

\`\`\`json
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "app": {
        "browser": "firefox"
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Specify browser path manually

If the browser is installed in a non-standard location:

\`\`\`json
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "app": {
        "browser": "chrome",
        "executablePath": "/custom/path/to/chrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Option 3: Run in headless mode

If browser UI isn't working but headless mode might:

\`\`\`json
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "app": {
        "browser": "chrome",
        "headless": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Prevention

To avoid browser launch issues:

- **Install browsers system-wide**: Use official installers, not portable versions
- **Keep browsers updated**: Update browsers regularly
- **Test your environment**: Run a simple test after setup
- **Document your setup**: Note browser versions in your README

## If this doesn't help

If you've tried these solutions and still have issues:

1. **Check detailed error logs**: Run with `--logLevel debug`
   \`\`\`bash
   npx doc-detective runTests --logLevel debug
   \`\`\`

2. **Try a minimal test**: Rule out test-specific issues
   \`\`\`json
   {
     "tests": [{
       "steps": [{
         "action": "goTo",
         "url": "https://example.com"
       }]
     }]
   }
   \`\`\`

3. **Report the issue**: [Open an issue](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/issues) with:
   - Your operating system and version
   - Browser and version
   - Complete error message
   - Output from `npx doc-detective runTests --logLevel debug`

4. **Ask for help**: Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF) and share your issue in #help
