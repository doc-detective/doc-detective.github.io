# How-To Guide Template

Use this template for task-oriented documentation that helps users accomplish a specific goal.

## When to use this template

Use a how-to guide when users:

- Know what they want to accomplish
- Need step-by-step instructions
- Want to complete a specific task
- Already understand basic concepts

**Examples:**

- How to configure browser settings
- How to run tests in parallel
- How to capture screenshots
- How to use environment variables

## Template

Copy and adapt this template for your how-to guide:

```markdown
---
title: How to [accomplish task]
description: [One-sentence description of what users will accomplish]
---

# How to [accomplish task]

[One or two sentences explaining what this guide helps users do and why they might want to do it.]

## Before you begin

[List prerequisites and required setup. If none, remove this section.]

- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2
- Prerequisite 3

## Step 1: [First major action]

[Explain what this step accomplishes and why it's necessary.]

[Provide detailed instructions. Use numbered sub-steps if needed.]

\`\`\`[language] title="[filename if applicable]" [Code example or command] \`\`\`

[Explain what this code does or what to expect.]

## Step 2: [Second major action]

[Continue with subsequent steps, following the same pattern.]

## Step 3: [Third major action]

[Add as many steps as needed to complete the task.]

## Verify it works

[Optional: Provide a way for users to verify they completed the task successfully.]

[What should they see or be able to do?]

## Troubleshooting

[Optional: List common issues and solutions. If none, remove this section.]

### [Problem description]

**Cause:** [Why this happens]

**Solution:** [How to fix it]

### [Another problem]

**Cause:** [Why this happens]

**Solution:** [How to fix it]

## What's next

[Suggest related tasks or next steps. Optional but recommended.]

- [Related task 1](link)
- [Related task 2](link)
- [Learn more about X](link)
```

## Writing tips

### Keep it focused

- **One task per guide**: Don't try to cover multiple unrelated tasks
- **Clear scope**: State what the guide covers (and doesn't cover)
- **Direct instructions**: Get to the steps quickly

### Use clear headings

Step headings should describe actions:

✅ Good:

- Step 1: Configure the test environment
- Step 2: Create the test file
- Step 3: Run your first test

⛔ Avoid:

- Step 1: Configuration
- Step 2: Files
- Step 3: Execution

### Write imperative instructions

Start instructions with action verbs:

✅ Good:

- Click the **Settings** button
- Type `npm install` in the terminal
- Navigate to the config file

⛔ Avoid:

- You should click the Settings button
- The user can type npm install
- It's possible to navigate to the config

### Provide context

Explain why steps are necessary:

✅ Good:

> Create a `.env` file to store configuration values separately from your test code. This makes it easier to use different values for different environments.

⛔ Avoid:

> Create a `.env` file.

### Test your instructions

Before submitting:

1. ✅ Follow your own steps exactly as written
2. ✅ Verify the outcome matches what you documented
3. ✅ Test on a clean environment if possible
4. ✅ Note any assumptions or prerequisites

## Example how-to guide

Here's a complete example:

```markdown

title: How to run tests in parallel
description: Speed up test execution by running multiple tests simultaneously.
---

# How to run tests in parallel

Run multiple Doc Detective tests at the same time to reduce total execution time. This is useful when you have many tests or tests that take a long time to complete.

## Before you begin

- Doc Detective installed (`npm install -g doc-detective`)
- At least two test files to run
- Understanding of [test configuration](/docs/references/schemas/config)

## Step 1: Enable parallel execution

Add the `concurrency` option to your Doc Detective configuration file:

\`\`\`json title=".doc-detective.json" { "concurrency": 4 } \`\`\`

This runs up to 4 tests simultaneously. Adjust based on your system resources.

## Step 2: Run your tests

Execute tests as usual:

\`\`\`bash npx doc-detective runTests \`\`\`

Doc Detective automatically distributes tests across parallel workers.

## Step 3: Monitor execution

Watch the output to see parallel execution:

\`\`\` [INFO] Running tests with concurrency: 4 [INFO] Test 1: RUNNING [INFO] Test 2: RUNNING [INFO] Test 3: RUNNING [INFO] Test 4: RUNNING [INFO] Test 1: PASSED [INFO] Test 5: RUNNING \`\`\`

## Verify it works

Compare execution time with and without parallelization:

\`\`\`bash

# Without parallelization

time npx doc-detective runTests --concurrency 1

# With parallelization

time npx doc-detective runTests --concurrency 4 \`\`\`

You should see reduced execution time.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail in parallel but pass individually

**Cause:** Tests may have dependencies or shared state

**Solution:** Ensure tests are independent. Avoid:

- Shared files or resources
- Dependencies between tests
- Hardcoded ports or URLs

### System becomes unresponsive

**Cause:** Too many parallel tests for available resources

**Solution:** Reduce concurrency:

\`\`\`json { "concurrency": 2 } \`\`\`
